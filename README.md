This is a sample code in C++20, using the Win32 API.  
I made this in order to familiarize myself with this API.  
Thus, it contains a lot of comments overexplaining lots of stuff.  
Feel free to consult or reuse this however you want, no need to give credits.

If you have any questions about Win32, Microsoft Learn is the best website for documentation about it.  
[This tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/win32/learnwin32/learn-to-program-for-windows) in particular will help get started with all the basics.
