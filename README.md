This is a sample code in C++20, using the Win32 API.  
I made this in order to familiarize myself with this API.  
Thus, it contains a lot of comments overexplaining lots of stuff.  
Feel free to consult or reuse this however you want, no need to give credits.

If you have any questions about Win32, [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/) is the best website for documentation about it.  
[This tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/win32/learnwin32/learn-to-program-for-windows) in particular will help you get started with all the basics.
